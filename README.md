# `egui-directx10`: a Direct3D10 renderer for [`egui`](https://crates.io/crates/egui)

This crate aims to provide a *minimal* set of features and APIs to render
outputs from `egui` using Direct3D10.

## Quick Start

There is an [`egui-demo`](examples/egui-demo.rs) example, which demonstrates all you need to do to set up a minimal application
with Direct3D10 and `egui`. This example uses `winit` for window management and
event handling, while native Win32 APIs should also work well.

## Considerations

This crate is a fork of [`egui-directx11`](https://github.com/Nekomaru-PKU/egui-directx11)
designed to target DirectX 10 instead. This is very niche and not recommended for general use.

The shaders were built using [`gwihlidal/docker-fxc`](https://github.com/gwihlidal/docker-fxc):

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/shaders:/fxc/shaders" gwihlidal/fxc /T vs_4_0 /E vs_main shaders/egui.hlsl /Fo shaders/egui_vs.bin
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/shaders:/fxc/shaders" gwihlidal/fxc /T ps_4_0 /E ps_main shaders/egui.hlsl /Fo shaders/egui_ps.bin
```

The original considerations section follows:

---

This crate is a successor to [`egui-d3d11`](https://crates.io/crates/egui-d3d11),
which is no longer maintained and has certain issues or inconvenience in some cases.

We assume you to be familiar with developing
graphics applications using Direct3D11, and if not, this crate is not likely
useful for you. Besides, this crate cares only about rendering outputs
from `egui`, so it is all *your* responsibility to handle things like
setting up the window and event loop, creating the device and swap chain, etc.

This crate is built upon the *official* Rust bindings of Direct3D11 and DXGI APIs
from the [`windows`](https://crates.io/crates/windows) crate [maintained by
Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs). Using this crate with
other Direct3D11 bindings is not recommended and may result in unexpected behavior.

## Project Status and Versioning Compatibility on `windows` and `egui`

This crate has been considered as general available without known issues since
version `0.3.1`. Though, it keeps bumping major version to follow major version
bumps on its direct dependencies, namely `windows` and  `egui`.

To select a version for this crate according to the `windows` and `egui` version
your project uses, please check the table below:

|`egui-directx11`|`windows`|`egui`|
|-|-|-|
|0.5.0|0.58.0|0.28.x|
|0.4.0|0.56.0|0.27.x|
|0.3.1|0.54.0|0.27.x|

Releases of this crate before `0.3.1` are considered premature and are not recommended to use.
